# albanian-names-dataset

A curated dataset of albanian first names.

There is plenty of data on the web, plenty of lists, databases, datasets, some public some not.
However we need a unified dataset that should be free to use for everyone.
Instead of scavenging the web for a list of names developers can instead just use a curated list that is maintained and added to over time.

# Simplicity over everything

This repo only contains a JSON file of names to not make matters complicated.
Additionally a npm pacakge might be created out of it.

# Source

Web. All the web will be searched to find and curate an ultimate list of albanian names. A big bonus would be if we were also able to somehow also explain their origins.

# Structure

Work in progress:
Currently we have 3 files:

- [male.json](/male.json)
- [female.json](/female.json)
- [names.json](/names.json)

Might think for a different strategy as we move on.
